This project is no longer maintained
==========================================

Facebook has *not very recently* changed the way login works for this library which has meant that the original login function is **broken**. Existing sessions and resuming a session from cookies still work, however may be broken at any time.

Other options that may/may not be working are:

- `fbchat-v2 by MinhHuyDev <https://github.com/MinhHuyDev/fbchat-v2>`
- `fbchat-Ex by TimLChan <https://github.com/TimLChan/fbchat-Ex>`


Previous description below
----------------------------------

This project is was previously maintained by `@madsmtm <https://github.com/madsmtm>`__ and `@carpedm20 <https://github.com/carpedm20>`__, but they both no longer have the time to continue to maintain the project. Therefore, this fork will try to maintain a workable solution until there is a proper maintainer available to add/modify functionality. Follow the discussion `in issue 613 <https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat/issues/613>`__ for updates on if/when a maintainer has been found.

Most importantly, this code has been maintained in a *works for me* approach, meaning that any issues that arise from the code fits into two buckets:

1.  It affects me and I'll try fix it
2.  It doesn't affect me and I probably won't look at it

If you've read through all that and still want to use the code, you can do the following:

.. code-block::

    $ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/TimLChan/fbchat.git

A powerful and efficient library to interact with
`Facebook's Messenger <https://www.facebook.com/messages/>`__, using just your email and password.

This is *not* an official API, Facebook has that `over here <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform>`__ for chat bots. This library differs by using a normal Facebook account instead.

``fbchat`` currently support:

- Sending many types of messages, with files, stickers, mentions, etc.
- Fetching all messages, threads and images in threads.
- Searching for messages and threads.
- Creating groups, setting the group emoji, changing nicknames, creating polls, etc.
- Listening for, an reacting to messages and other events in real-time.
- Type hints, and it has a modern codebase (e.g. only Python 3.5 and upwards).
- ``async``/``await`` (COMING).

Essentially, everything you need to make an amazing Facebook bot!


Version Warning
---------------
``v2`` is currently being developed at the ``master`` branch and it's highly unstable. If you want to view the old ``v1``, go `here <https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat/tree/v1>`__.

Additionally, you can view the project's progress `here <https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat/projects/2>`__.


Caveats
-------

``fbchat`` works by imitating what the browser does, and thereby tricking Facebook into thinking it's accessing the website normally.

However, there's a catch! **Using this library may not comply with Facebook's Terms Of Service!**, so be responsible Facebook citizens! We are not responsible if your account gets banned!

Additionally, **the APIs the library is calling is undocumented!** In theory, this means that your code could break tomorrow, without the slightest warning!
If this happens to you, please report it, so that we can fix it as soon as possible!
